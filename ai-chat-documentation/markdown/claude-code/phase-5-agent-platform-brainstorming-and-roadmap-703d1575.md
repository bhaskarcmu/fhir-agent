# Phase 5 agent-platform brainstorming and roadmap

## Turn 1

### Prompt

I want to start Phase 5. Here is a quick outcome of some brainstorming. Just internalize and wait for my next prompt for details. Not expecting any sustantive response to this prompt

___________________
✅ Agreed / decided 

Build the agent-platform capabilities once as a shared, reusable layer, pilot on mcp-agent (Phase 1 refill-triage agent — it already has the conversational shape), then carry to the Phase 2 claims stack.
Phase 5 is It's its own phase, NOT folded into Phase 2. Reasons settled: the "Phase 2 is cloud-ready" premise contradicts our documented cloud-delivery gap; this work is cloud-agnostic anyway; the conversational surface you described is Phase 1's agent; reopening a completed phase repeats the status-truthfulness problem; these are shared-platform capabilities.
Agent is becoming clinician-facing → the heavy tier (policy + judge, M6) is justified.
PHI-off-third-party = a future business rule → build the provider seam now, keep Anthropic the only live backend for now; target providers are Anthropic + Llama + DeepSeek.
Provider abstraction = two adapters only: Anthropic (native) + OpenAI-compatible (covers Llama, DeepSeek, Ollama, vLLM, and hosted endpoints). Llama-vs-DeepSeek becomes config, not code.
Output safety is a MUST: tool-with-enum-output + code validation + fail-closed to REVIEW.
policy.md into the system prompt — NOT RAG. RAG only for a genuine knowledge base, kept separate.
LLM-as-judge only for "important" responses, checking soft qualities; code enforces hard invariants.
Build order (by dependency, not your 1–5): M1 enum-gate → M2 OTel → M3 memory/context+session store → M4 deploy resilience+cost alerts → M5 provider abstraction → M6 policy+knowledge+judge. Minimal cut = M1 + M2.
Cheap Llama/DeepSeek testing: stub OpenAI-compatible server ($0 CI) / Ollama local ($0, weak — good adversary for the enum gate) / hosted OpenAI-compatible like DeepSeek API/OpenRouter/Groq (pennies, real quality).

🟡 Open issues to be brainstormed

Exact enum set for the pilot surface (dispense / review / don't-dispense is the shape; confirm the set and how REVIEW is the fail-closed sink).
Definition of an "important" response that triggers the judge.
Session-store tech (Redis vs Postgres — tie to existing infra) and where the shared platform layer lives (new agent-platform/ package vs in-place refactor).
Memory token-budget numbers — deliberately deferred until M2 metrics exist so they're set from data, not guessed.
Conversational transport — CLI REPL today; is the clinician surface a web/chat UI or API? (drives streaming + session design).
M6 RAG corpus (formulary? drug info?) or defer RAG entirely.
Phase number/name — a docs/phase5/ readiness-assessment already exists; confirm this is Phase 5 vs Phase 6, and whether the observability slice formally closes Phase 2's unbuilt R15.
