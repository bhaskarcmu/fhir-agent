# Phase 2 - prescription claim adjudication prototype

## Turn 1

### Prompt

This whole system has to be capable of running locally for development, and be very easily switchable to being deployed in the cloud. The Kong gateway has to be carefully placed in the architecture. Note where it already is, and where it needs to be. There can me multiple APIs as part of the architecture in different places, but there has to be a clear diagram and thought process where they are. Elaborate on your thoughts regarding these matters

### Claude response

Let me look at how Kong is actually wired today before reasoning about where it should go — the gateway config, compose, deploy script, and k8s manifests.

Critical finding: **Kong is not in docker-compose at all** — locally everything talks directly to the FHIR container; Kong exists only as k8s/Helm config for cloud. Let me read the gateway config and k8s manifests to see exactly what it fronts.

Now I have the full picture. Let me confirm the cloud deploy pattern and k8s layout quickly.
